# Terminal Coursework

In this coursework we want to practice navigating around the filesystem using the command line interface.

## Setup
This is a good opportunity to take advantage of some of the features of VS Code to make it easier to see all the components necessary for this assignment.
* Open a Terminal Window - click View => Terminal, or Ctrl-`.
* Preview the README Markup file in the editor panel. - right click on the README file in the Explorer and click **Open Preview**.  
* Expand the **MyDocuments** folder in the Explorer so that you can see where the folders/files are that you need to locate in this exericse.
* Open the README file by clicking on it in the Explorer. You are going to answer questions in the README file, so you'll need to open it for editing. 

## Tasks

### 1) Find my script

In this repository you'll find `MyDocuments` - this is all the documents that I use on my laptop.

I need to find the `script.js` file that is a part of MyFirstWebsite however you are **not** allowed to use a GUI, you must use Command Line and the Terminal.

What commands would I need to change directory to the directory containing `script.js`? In the section below, write all the commands you used.

Hint: You should use `cd` and `ls`.
